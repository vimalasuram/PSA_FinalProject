/**
 * Represents a base class for a geographic graph where vertices are points on Earth's surface,
 * and edges represent connections between them. This graph operates within spherical coordinates.
 *
 * <p>This class extends the {@link Graph_Edges} class, inheriting the structure and behavior of
 * a generic edge-based graph. It also implements the {@link Geo} interface, ensuring that all
 * graphs of this type are capable of specific geographic operations.
 *
 * <p>The class provides a concrete implementation for the {@code goeEdges} method, which
 * retrieves the edges of the graph as a {@link SizedIterable}.
 *
 * @param <V> the vertex type, which must extend {@link GeoPoint}. Represents the points on Earth's surface.
 * @param <E> the edge type, representing the attributes or properties of the connection between vertices.
