 * The GeoKruskal class extends the Kruskal algorithm to work with geo-referenced graphs.

 * The generic type parameters specify the types for vertices and edge attributes:
 * - V extends GeoPoint: Vertices are defined as GeoPoint objects, which represent
 * geographical locations with name and position information.
 * - X extends Comparable<X> & Sequenced: Edge attributes must implement Comparable for
 * weight comparison and Sequenced for maintaining a sequence order.
 * <p>
 * This class operates on graphs provided by the EdgeGraph interface.
 *
 * @param <V> the type of vertices in the graph, extending GeoPoint.
 * @param <X> the type of edge attributes, extending Comparable and implementing Sequenced.
