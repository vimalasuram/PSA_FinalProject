/**
 * The {@code Dijkstra} class represents a data type for solving the
 * single-source shortest paths problem in edge-weighted digraphs
 * where the edge weights are non-negative.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses <em>Dijkstra's algorithm</em> with a
 * <em>binary heap</em>. The constructor takes
 * &Theta;(<em>E</em> log <em>V</em>) time in the worst case,
 * where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>E</em> is
 * the number of edges. Each instance method takes &Theta;(1) time.
 * It uses &Theta;(<em>V</em>) extra space (not including the
 * edge-weighted digraph).
 * <p>
 * This correctly computes shortest paths if all arithmetic performed is
 * without floating-point rounding error or arithmetic overflow.
 * This is the case if all edge weights are integers and if none of the
 * intermediate results exceeds 2<sup>52</sup>. Since all intermediate
 * results are sums of edge weights, they are bounded by <em>V C</em>,
 * where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>C</em> is the maximum
 * weight of any edge.
