/**
 * The {@code Kruskal} class implements Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST)
 * of an edge-weighted, undirected graph. It extends the {@code MST} abstract class and utilizes
 * data structures such as a priority queue and a union-find structure for efficient processing.
 *
 * This class operates on graphs represented by the {@code EdgeGraph<V, X>} interface, where edges
 * are defined by a pair of vertices and an associated attribute. The attribute must implement the
 * {@code Comparable} interface for edge weight comparisons, and the {@code Sequenced} interface
 * for sequence assignment in the resulting MST.
 *
 * The algorithm processes edges in non-decreasing order of their weights, adding them to the MST
 * if they connect disjoint components without forming cycles.
 *
 * @param <V> the type representing vertices in the graph.
 * @param <X> the type of the edge attributes; must implement {@code Comparable<X>} and {@code Sequenced}.
