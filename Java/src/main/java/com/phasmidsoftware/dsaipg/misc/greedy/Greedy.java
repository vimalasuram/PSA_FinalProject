/**
 * A generic class implementing a greedy algorithm.
 * <p>
 * This class models a problem-solving approach where local optimizations
 * are made at each step in order to find the global solution,
 * assuming that the global solution can be constructed from these local optimizations.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the greedy candidate and intermediary states.
 * @param <R> the type of the result produced by the greedy algorithm.
 *            <p>
 *            The class is initialized with the following functional parameters:
 *            - A function applied iteratively to select the next "greedy" candidate.
 *            - A function to adjust the state after selecting the "greedy" candidate.
 *            - A function to aggregate the current result with the "greedy" candidate.
 *            - A function to determine completion of the algorithm.
 *            These parameters define the behavior of the greedy algorithm.
