/**
 * The Equable class provides an implementation for equality and hash code based on a collection of elements.
 * Instances of this class are considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order. Additionally,
 * the hash code is calculated based on the elements in the collection to ensure consistent behavior with equals.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be extended by other classes that require customizable equability behavior based on
 * collections of elements. It uses element-wise comparison to determine equality, ensuring that all elements
 * in both instances must match exactly.
 * <p>
 * The equality check ensures the following:
 * - The collections being compared must have the same number of elements.
 * - Each corresponding element in the collections must be equal.
 * <p>
 * The class leverages the `Collection` interface for storing and iterating over the elements. It is the caller's
 * responsibility to ensure that the elements in the collection provide appropriate implementations of hashCode
 * and equals for expected behavior of Equable instances.
