/**
 * BaseEquable is an abstract class that provides a foundation for defining objects with custom
 * equality and hash code behaviors based on their internal components. It relies on the concept
 * of an {@code Equable} instance to determine equality and hash code.
 * <p>
 * Classes extending this abstract class are expected to implement the {@code getEquable} method,
 * which supplies an {@code Equable} instance representing the elements of the object to be used
 * for equality and hash code calculations.
 * <p>
 * The {@code equals} method ensures that two instances of a subclass of {@code BaseEquable} are
 * equal if and only if their {@code Equable} instances are equal. Equality is determined based
 * on the underlying elements of the {@code Equable} instances.
 * <p>
 * The {@code hashCode} method computes the hash code by delegating to the {@code Equable} instance,
 * taking into consideration the elements of the {@code Equable}.
