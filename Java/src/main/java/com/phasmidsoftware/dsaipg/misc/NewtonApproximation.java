 * The NewtonApproximation class demonstrates the Newton-Raphson method to find an approximate solution
 * for the equation cos(x) = x.
 * <p>
 * The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique used to approximate the roots of a real-valued function.
 * In this case, the method solves the equation by iterating until the calculated y value (cos(x) - x) is close
 * enough to zero within a given tolerance.
 * <p>
 * The iterative formula used is:
 * x = x + y / (sin(x) + 1)
 * where:
 * y = cos(x) - x
 * <p>
 * The solution stops when the absolute value of y is less than the specified tolerance (1E-7).
 * <p>
 * This implementation demonstrates the use of a fixed iteration limit (200) to ensure termination,
 * and it displays the found solution if the convergence criterion is met within this limit.
