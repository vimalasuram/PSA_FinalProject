/**
 * The ShuntingYard class implements the Shunting Yard algorithm for evaluating mathematical expressions
 * in infix notation. This algorithm converts infix expressions to postfix notation and evaluates them
 * using operator precedence and associativity.
 * <p>
 * The class supports the basic mathematical operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*),
 * division (/), and parentheses for grouping. It uses stacks to manage operators and operands during the evaluation.
 * <p>
 * Main features of the class:
 * - Parsing tokens from an infix expression.
 * - Handling operator precedence and associativity.
 * - Evaluating the expression to produce a numeric result.
 * - Detecting and throwing exceptions for invalid expressions such as mismatched parentheses or unrecognized operators.
 * <p>
 * Dependencies:
 * - StringTokenizer for breaking down the input infix expression into tokens.
 * - Custom BQSException for error handling specific to the algorithm.
 * - Stack_LinkedList for managing stacks of operators and operands.
